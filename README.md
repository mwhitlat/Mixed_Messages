# Mixed Messages 
A program to return a random response using JS
## Typical Golf Sayings
I'm a fan of golf- and I've ***codified*** several of the responses I say to myself or others during a round.

> Examples include:
> + "Crushed that drive"
> + "Sunk that putt"
> + "Hooked that shot"

### Code description:
The code is pretty basic, and is outlined in these steps:
+ create arrays to pull words from (shots, desciptors, pronouns)
+ create variables to hold random indicies of each array
+ create 'message' variable to pull it all together
